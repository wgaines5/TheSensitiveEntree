    //Lamb Scewers
    <string name="lambscewers_name">Lamb Scewers</string>
    <string name="lambscewers_ingreds">Ingredients: \n1. 2 lbs of lamb leg meat at least 15% fat\n2. 2 cups of onion slices\n3. 4-5 cloves of crushed garlic\n4. 1.5 tbsp of cumin seeds\n5. 2 tsp of Sichuan peppercorn\n6. 1 tsp of white pepper\n7. 1 tsp of white pepper\n8. 2.5 tbsp mild chili flake optional\n9. 1 tsp of spicy chili flake optional\n10.2 to 3 tsp of salt or taste
    \n
    \nDirections:\n1. Lamb shoulder and leg are the best cut for making bbq skewers because you can get some large chunks of meat out of them. Cut the lamb into 1-inch size pieces. Don’t cut it too small or else it will dry out quickly while grilling.
\n\n2. Marinade the lamb meat with 2 cups of onion slices and 4 cloves of crushed garlic. Cover it and let it sit for 40 minutes. This is to help gentle some off that strong lamb smell. Also, the enzyme in the onion can tenderize the meat. I have seen people use onion puree instead of the slices. That way the meat will be a bit too wet. When you put wet meat onto a hot grill, it will stick on the grill.
\n\n3. While waiting, you can make the spice powder. Toast 1.5 tbsp of cumin seeds, 2 tsp of Sichuan peppercorn, a tsp of fennel seeds, a tsp of white peppercorn in a cast-iron skillet for 3-5 minutes. Then blend into a fine powder. I always prefer a freshly ground spice mix. It makes a huge difference in taste.
\n\n4. To spice up my BBQ, I also like to use some red chili flake. To get the spicy level that I like, I will mix some mild chili flake with some face heaven chili powder.
\n\n5. Besides that, you will need some salt which we will sprinkle it on while you are grilling.
\n\n6. Put the lamb onto the skewers. Set your grill at high temperature. The thermometer attachment on my grill shows it reaches 500 F. If the temperature is too low, it will take much longer to chared the meat and there is a higher chance that the lamb will be dried out.
\n\n7. Sprinkle some salt. Be generous because some of the salt might fall off while cooking and turning. I will say for 2 pounds of meat, you will need about 2-3 tsp of salt.
\n\n8. It will take a few minutes on each side for it to charred. Once both sides have that nice color, the meat is about medium-rare. The way I like is medium-well so I lower the distance of the charcoal. Let the meat cook for a few minutes more. Keep turning until it reaches the desired color or the doneness that you like.
\n\n9. Once you think it is almost done, you can sprinkle the spice mix and chili flake onto the meat. Take the meat off the grill and enjoy!</string>

    <string name="beans_name">Beans Bourguignon</string>
    <string name="beans_ingreds">Ingredients:
    \n1. 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
\n2. 1 1/2 cups boiling water
\n3. 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil
\n4. 1 pound cremini mushrooms, quartered
\n5. Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
\n6. 3 small carrots (about 5 ounces), sliced 1/8 inch thick
\n7. 1 medium onion (about 10 ounces), chopped
\n8. 2 tablespoons tomato paste
\n9. 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped
\n10. 1 teaspoon fresh oregano leaves, chopped
\n11. 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
\n12. 1 1/2 cups vegan dry red wine, such as cabernet sauvignon
\n13. 8 ounces frozen pearl onions (about 2 cups)
\n14. Two 15-ounce cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
\n15. 1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped, plus more for garnish, optional
\n16. 12 ounces cavatappi pasta
    \n
    \nDirections:
    \n1. Place the porcini mushrooms in a medium heat-safe bowl. Pour the boiling water over top and let the porcini soak until the liquid is a very dark brown, about 20 minutes. Strain the liquid into a small liquid measuring cup (you should have about 3/4 cup), then chop the porcini and set aside.
\n\n2. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the cremini mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of black pepper and stir so the cremini are in an even layer. Let the cremini cook, untouched, until starting to caramelize, about 3 minutes. Stir the cremini a few times and then continue to cook, untouched, until golden brown, about 3 minutes more. Transfer to a medium bowl with a slotted spoon and return the pot to the burner.
\n\n3. Add another 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to the pot along with the carrots, onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, thyme, oregano, garlic and reserved porcini and cook, stirring frequently, until the tomato paste is toasted and turns a deep maroon color, 2 to 3 minutes.
\n\n4. Stir in the wine, bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Fold in the pearl onions, cannellini, cremini, reserved porcini water, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon and the mushrooms are very soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Fold in 1/2 cup of the parsley.
\n\n5. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente according to package directions. Drain the pasta and add it back to the pot. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1/2 cup parsley, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Serve the beans bourguignon on top of the herbed pasta and garnish with more parsley if desired.</string>
