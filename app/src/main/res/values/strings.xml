    //Lamb Scewers
    <string name="lambscewers_name">Lamb Scewers</string>
    <string name="lambscewers_ingreds">Ingredients: \n1. 2 lbs of lamb leg meat at least 15% fat\n2. 2 cups of onion slices\n3. 4-5 cloves of crushed garlic\n4. 1.5 tbsp of cumin seeds\n5. 2 tsp of Sichuan peppercorn\n6. 1 tsp of white pepper\n7. 1 tsp of white pepper\n8. 2.5 tbsp mild chili flake optional\n9. 1 tsp of spicy chili flake optional\n10.2 to 3 tsp of salt or taste
    \n
    \nDirections:\n1. Lamb shoulder and leg are the best cut for making bbq skewers because you can get some large chunks of meat out of them. Cut the lamb into 1-inch size pieces. Don’t cut it too small or else it will dry out quickly while grilling.
\n\n2. Marinade the lamb meat with 2 cups of onion slices and 4 cloves of crushed garlic. Cover it and let it sit for 40 minutes. This is to help gentle some off that strong lamb smell. Also, the enzyme in the onion can tenderize the meat. I have seen people use onion puree instead of the slices. That way the meat will be a bit too wet. When you put wet meat onto a hot grill, it will stick on the grill.
\n\n3. While waiting, you can make the spice powder. Toast 1.5 tbsp of cumin seeds, 2 tsp of Sichuan peppercorn, a tsp of fennel seeds, a tsp of white peppercorn in a cast-iron skillet for 3-5 minutes. Then blend into a fine powder. I always prefer a freshly ground spice mix. It makes a huge difference in taste.
\n\n4. To spice up my BBQ, I also like to use some red chili flake. To get the spicy level that I like, I will mix some mild chili flake with some face heaven chili powder.
\n\n5. Besides that, you will need some salt which we will sprinkle it on while you are grilling.
\n\n6. Put the lamb onto the skewers. Set your grill at high temperature. The thermometer attachment on my grill shows it reaches 500 F. If the temperature is too low, it will take much longer to chared the meat and there is a higher chance that the lamb will be dried out.
\n\n7. Sprinkle some salt. Be generous because some of the salt might fall off while cooking and turning. I will say for 2 pounds of meat, you will need about 2-3 tsp of salt.
\n\n8. It will take a few minutes on each side for it to charred. Once both sides have that nice color, the meat is about medium-rare. The way I like is medium-well so I lower the distance of the charcoal. Let the meat cook for a few minutes more. Keep turning until it reaches the desired color or the doneness that you like.
\n\n9. Once you think it is almost done, you can sprinkle the spice mix and chili flake onto the meat. Take the meat off the grill and enjoy!</string>

    \n1. 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
\n2. 1 1/2 cups boiling water
\n3. 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil
\n4. 1 pound cremini mushrooms, quartered
\n5. Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
\n6. 3 small carrots (about 5 ounces), sliced 1/8 inch thick
\n7. 1 medium onion (about 10 ounces), chopped
\n8. 2 tablespoons tomato paste
\n9. 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped
\n10. 1 teaspoon fresh oregano leaves, chopped
\n11. 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
\n12. 1 1/2 cups vegan dry red wine, such as cabernet sauvignon

\n15. 1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped, plus more for garnish, optional
\n16. 12 ounces cavatappi pasta
    \n
    \nDirections:
    \n1. Place the porcini mushrooms in a medium heat-safe bowl. Pour the boiling water over top and let the porcini soak until the liquid is a very dark brown, about 20 minutes. Strain the liquid into a small liquid measuring cup (you should have about 3/4 cup), then chop the porcini and set aside.
\n\n2. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the cremini mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of black pepper and stir so the cremini are in an even layer. Let the cremini cook, untouched, until starting to caramelize, about 3 minutes. Stir the cremini a few times and then continue to cook, untouched, until golden brown, about 3 minutes more. Transfer to a medium bowl with a slotted spoon and return the pot to the burner.
\n\n3. Add another 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to the pot along with the carrots, onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, thyme, oregano, garlic and reserved porcini and cook, stirring frequently, until the tomato paste is toasted and turns a deep maroon color, 2 to 3 minutes.
\n\n4. Stir in the wine, bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Fold in the pearl onions, cannellini, cremini, reserved porcini water, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon and the mushrooms are very soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Fold in 1/2 cup of the parsley.
\n\n5. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente according to package directions. Drain the pasta and add it back to the pot. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1/2 cup parsley, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Serve the beans bourguignon on top of the herbed pasta and garnish with more parsley if desired.</string>

    //Pan-Roasted Double Cut Lamb Chops
    <string name="lamb_name">Pan-Roasted Double Cut Lamb Chops</string>
    <string name="lamb_ingreds">Ingredients:
    \n1. 2 racks of lamb (8 bones per rack; about 2 pounds each), trimmed and frenched by your butcher
\n2. 2 cups plus 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
\n3. 10 sprigs rosemary, 8 stripped and roughly chopped and 2 whole, plus more for garnish
\n4. 10 sprigs oregano, 8 roughly chopped and 2 whole, plus more for garnish
\n5. 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
\n6. 1 tablespoon Aleppo pepper (or 3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes)
\n7. Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
\n8. 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
\n9. Flaky sea salt, for topping
    \n
    \nDirections:
    \n1. Cut each rack of lamb into 4 double chops of even thickness. Stir together 2 cups olive oil, the chopped rosemary and oregano, the garlic and 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper (or 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes) in a large bowl. Add the lamb chops, bones up, and rub the mixture evenly over the meat. Cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight.
\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 400˚. Remove the lamb from the refrigerator and wipe off any excess marinade with a paper towel. Season generously with kosher salt and a few grinds of pepper.
\n\n3. Heat an extra-large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and heat until shimmering. Add the lamb, rounded fat–side down. Cook until well browned, about 4 minutes. Turn the chops on their sides in the skillet and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Turn the chops so the fat side is facing up and cook 2 to 3 more minutes. (It’s OK if some of the bones are sticking out of the skillet to make space.) Carefully pour off the fat from the skillet and transfer the skillet to the oven. Roast until a thermometer inserted into the center of the lamb registers 125˚ for medium-rare to medium doneness, 5 to 7 minutes.
\n\n4. Return the skillet to the stove top over medium-high heat; add the butter and rosemary and oregano sprigs to an open space in the pan. Let the butter melt and start to foam, then baste the chops with the butter a few times until well coated.
\n\n5. Transfer the chops to a platter and top with any remaining butter from the skillet. Sprinkle with flaky salt and the remaining 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper (or 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes). Garnish with rosemary and oregano sprigs. </string>

    //Slow-Cooker Pot Roast
    <string name="roast_name">Slow-Cooker Pot Roast</string>
    <string name="roast_ingreds">Ingredients:
    \n1. One 4-pound beef chuck roast
\n2. Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
\n3. 1/3 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for coating
\n4. 3 tablespoons olive oil
\n5. 4 medium carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces
\n6. 3 stalks celery, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
\n7. 1 medium onion, cut into 1/2-inch wedges
\n8. 3 cloves garlic, mashed
\n9. 3 tablespoons tomato paste
\n10. 1 cup red wine
\n11. 3 cups low-sodium beef broth
\n12. 3 bay leaves
\n13. 2 sprigs fresh thyme
\n14. 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
\n15. 1/2 cup loosely packed parsley leaves, chopped
    \n
    \nDirections:
    \n1. Sprinkle the roast all over with 2 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper. Coat in flour and shake off any excess. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the roast to the skillet and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 8 minutes, turning as needed. Transfer the roast to the insert of a 6-quart slow cooker, along with the carrots, celery, onions and garlic.
\n\n2. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet over medium heat. Add the tomato paste and stir until the oil begins to turn brick-red, about 1 minute. Add the flour and wine and whisk until thick (it is OK if there are some lumps). Add the beef broth, bay leaves, thyme, allspice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and bring to a simmer, whisking, until the gravy is smooth and thickens slightly, about 4 minutes.
\n\n3. Pour the gravy into the slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours. The roast and vegetables should be tender.
\n\n4. Remove the roast and let rest for a few minutes. Discard the thyme stems and strain the vegetables, reserving the gravy. Toss the vegetables with half the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Stir the remaining parsley into the gravy and season with salt and pepper. Slice the roast against the grain. Serve the meat and vegetables on a platter, moistening them with some of the gravy; serve the remaining gravy on the side.</string>
